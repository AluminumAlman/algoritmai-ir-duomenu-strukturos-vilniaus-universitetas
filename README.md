# n-nonattacking-queens-m-length-triangle-board
Written in C, both recursive and non-recursive implementations of finding solutions to the "n non-attacking queens on an m triangle board".  
Should only use recursive if it's necessary, as was for my (Lithuanian) univeristy task.  
PS: if you're attending Vilnius University and get Čyras, sėkmės :)
